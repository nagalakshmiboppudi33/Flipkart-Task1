🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a robust data pipeline that consolidates sales data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, JSON). The pipeline focuses on:

Data Cleaning (handling missing values, type consistency, formatting)

Data Integration (merging and unifying data from various formats)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (identifying patterns and trends)

Visualization & Reporting (delivering insights through dashboards and exports)

This project demonstrates core data science and business analytics skills essential for enterprise-level data handling.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
